# Engineering Build:
## 1. Ideation/Conceptualization of a Product
       --> Start with a well researched concept
       --> Have a product concept that somehow would transform the current market you are targeting
## 2. Creating a virtual Model using 3D CAD Tools
       --> Fully developed(well researched) ideas/concepts need to be transformed into 3D CAD Models
       --> Create 3D CAD Files for proto-builds
## 3. Prototyping (Creating proof-of-concept-PROC or proto-build)
       --> Done multiple times to zero-in on the final, MP-ready design
       --> Small test run of key product concepts to gain confidence that they can work
       --> Goals: To provide a proof of concept that demonstrates functionality to be vetted out by customers, clients, and even the design team itself.
       --> A combination of different form factors, including WORKS-LIKE & LOOKS LIKE
       --> POC --> EVT --> DVT --> PVT 
       --> Possibly: P1 --> P1.5 -->P2 -->P3 -->EVT1 -->EVT2 -->DVT --> PVT --> Ramp --> MP/PB(Pilot Build)
       --> 10 or fewer builds
       --> EVT: typically 100 to 1000
       --> DVT's typical quantities: 300 to 2000
       --> PVT's typical quantities: 1K to 20K
## 4. Test Your Product on the Market
      --> Get valuable feedback from potential customers to make the product MP-ready
      --> Customers provide crucial pieces of feedback
## 5. Mass Production (MP)
      --> Increased volume, Assembly, and Quality Finishing constitute this phase
       --> PVT is the “last build” — the units you are building are supposedly intended to be sold to customers, if they pass all of your test stations. PVT typically transitions directly into Ramp and Mass Production, or a Pilot build with no time gap.
      --> PVT flows immediately into the phase of the program called Ramp, where parallel assembly lines are being brought up to increase daily output volume.
      --> Mass Production is a superset of Ramp and the sustaining production that follows.
