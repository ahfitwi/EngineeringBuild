# Engineering Build:
## 1. Ideation/Conceptualization of a Product
       --> Start with a well researched concept
       --> Have a product concept that somehow would transform the current market you are targeting
## 2. Creating a virtual Model using 3D CAD Tools
       --> Fully developed(well researched) ideas/concepts need to be transformed into 3D CAD Models
       --> Create 3D CAD Files for proto-builds
## 3. Prototyping (Creating proof-of-concept-PROC or proto-build)
       --> Done multiple times to zero-in on the final, MP-ready design
       --> Small test run of key product concepts to gain confidence that they can work
       --> Goals: To provide a proof of concept that demonstrates functionality to be vetted out by customers, clients, and even the design team itself.
       --> A combination of different form factors, including WORKS-LIKE & LOOKS LIKE
       --> POC --> EVT --> DVT --> PVT 
       --> Possibly: P1 --> P1.5 -->P2 -->P3 -->EVT1 -->EVT2 -->DVT --> PVT --> Ramp --> MP/PB(Pilot Build)
       --> 10 or fewer builds
       --> EVT: typically 100 to 1000
       --> DVT's typical quantities: 300 to 2000
       --> PVT's typical quantities: 1K to 20K
## 4. Test Your Product on the Market
      --> Get valuable feedback from potential customers to make the product MP-ready
      --> Customers provide crucial pieces of feedback
## 5. Mass Production (MP)
      --> Increased volume, Assembly, and Quality Finishing constitute this phase
      --> PVT is the “last build” — the units you are building are supposedly intended to be sold to customers, if they pass all of your test stations. PVT typically transitions directly into Ramp and Mass Production, or a Pilot build with no time gap.
      --> PVT flows immediately into the phase of the program called Ramp, where parallel assembly lines are being brought up to increase daily output volume.
      --> Mass Production is a superset of Ramp and the sustaining production that follows.
      
# TYPICAL HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE:
## 1. Request For Proposal (RFP):
      --> A request for proposal (RFP) is a business document that announces a project, describes it, and solicits bids from qualified contractors to complete it.
## 2. Technical Response Proposal(TRP):
     --> Technical Response means the information, which will be evaluated and scored, the Proponent submits within OTP as part of the Technical Envelope;
     --> Information attached as part of the Commercial Envelope in OTP will not be considered as part of the evaluation of Stage II - Technical Response.
     --> The reference checks themselves will not be scored, however, OECM may adjust Technical Response scores related to the information obtained during the reference check.
     --> Provide a detailed explanation of the Offeror’s ability to provide the goods and services detailed in the Work Statement (Statement of work -- SOW).
## 3. Schedule
      --> A product development schedule representative of what a typical consumer electronics company might come up with and adopt is:
